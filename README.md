# Codeforces-Solutions

This is the official repo to my Codeforces account in the name rosahood. 
-  Rating: 383
-  Over 10+ problems solved

This repo contains my personal CP solutions from Codeforces, both competitions and problemset. Please note that while I do not upload my solutions to active virtual contests or live competitions, I highly discourage referring to these solutions during a live contest.

Contents:
1. Rating Folders: The solutions have been organised in order of the ratings of the problemset as given in codeforces. The solutions have been named according to their problem ID on cf.
2. [`!mapping.txt`] files are located within each folder to map the corresponding problem IDs to their respective names and their Codeforces link.
3. [`!template.cpp`]: the template which I use on codeforces, written in C++. This may be used by anyone who wishes to use this template.
