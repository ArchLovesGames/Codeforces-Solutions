## 📁 Contents

- **📊 Rating Folders:**  
  All problems are organized by their Codeforces difficulty rating (e.g., `0800`, `1000`, ...). Each folder contains `.cpp` files named by their **problem ID**.

- **🗺️ [`!mapping.txt`](./0800/!mapping.txt):**  
  Located in each folder, this maps problem IDs to their official **titles** and **Codeforces links**.

- **🧰 [`!template.cpp`](./!template.cpp):**  
  My personal **C++ template** used during contests.  
  Feel free to use or adapt it for your own contests and practice.
