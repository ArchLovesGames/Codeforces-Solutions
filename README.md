# Codeforces-Solutions

This repo contains my personal CP solutions from Codeforces. Codeforces has allowed me to thoroughly enjoy optimising algorithms within time constraints. Please note that while I do not upload my solutions to active virtual contests or live competitions, I highly discourage referring to these solutions during a live contest.
