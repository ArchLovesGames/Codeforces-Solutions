# Codeforces-Solutions

This is the official repo to my Codeforces account in the name rosahood. 
-  Rating: 383
-  Over 10+ problems solved

This repo contains my personal CP solutions from Codeforces, both competitions and problemset. Please note that while I do not upload my solutions to active virtual contests or live competitions, I highly discourage referring to these solutions during a live contest.

Contents:
1. Rating Folders: The solutions have been organised in order of the ratings of the problemset as given in codeforces. The solutions have been named according to their problem ID on cf. Each folder has a !mapping.txt file to map the problem name and link to the corresponding ID.
2. template.cpp: the template which I use on codeforces, written in C++. This may be used by anyone who wishes to use this template.
