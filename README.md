#  Codeforces-Solutions

This is the official repo linked to my Codeforces account under the handle **rosahood**.

-  **Current Rating**: 383  
-  **Problems Solved**: 10+  
-  This repo contains my personal **Competitive Programming (CP)** solutions from Codeforces — both from **contests** and the **problemset**.
-  I primarily use C++ for my code, but I also use C and Java occasionally

⚠️ **Note:**  
I do **not** upload solutions to *active virtual contests* or *live contests*.  
Please refrain from referring to these solutions during any live rounds — it's meant for learning and post-practice only.

## Contents

- **Rating Folders:**  
  All problems are organized by their Codeforces difficulty rating (e.g., `0800`, `1000`, ...). Each folder contains `.cpp`, `.c`, and `.java`  files named by their **problem ID**.

- **[`!mapping.txt`](./0800/!mapping.txt):**  
  Located in each folder, this maps problem IDs to their official **titles** and **Codeforces links**.

- **[`!template.cpp`](./!template.cpp):**  
  My personal **C++ template** used during contests.  
  Feel free to use or adapt it for your own contests and practice.
